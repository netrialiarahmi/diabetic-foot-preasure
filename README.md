# üè• Advanced Diabetic Foot Analysis System

This project is a web-based tool designed for the comprehensive analysis of diabetic foot conditions. It leverages a powerful dual-AI approach, combining a custom Deep Learning model for classification with advanced Large Language Models (from OpenAI) for detailed qualitative analysis and care recommendations.

The application provides a holistic assessment by analyzing images of both the left and right foot, delivering insights that are both quantitative and descriptive.

## üöÄ How It Works

The system follows a multi-step analysis pipeline to provide a comprehensive report:

1.  **Dual Image Upload**: The user uploads clear images of both the left and right foot through the interactive Streamlit interface.

2.  **Step 1: Deep Learning Classification (MobileNetV3)**:

      * A custom **PyTorch model** based on a Siamese-like architecture with **MobileNetV3** backbones processes both foot images simultaneously.
      * This model performs a binary classification to determine if the feet exhibit characteristics commonly associated with diabetes, outputting a prediction (**Diabetic** or **Non-Diabetic**) and a confidence score.

3.  **Step 2: Detailed Vision Analysis (GPT-4o-mini)**:

      * Each foot image is individually sent to the **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini Vision API**.
      * A highly structured prompt guides the AI to act as an expert podiatrist, performing a detailed examination of:
          * Skin Health (color, texture, calluses)
          * Circulation Indicators (swelling, discoloration)
          * Structural Deformities
          * Wounds or Ulcers
          * Nail Condition

4.  **Step 3: Actionable Recommendations (GPT-4)**:

      * The results from the classification model and the detailed vision analyses for both feet are aggregated.
      * This consolidated information is then sent to **OpenAI's GPT-4 model**.
      * Prompted as a senior diabetic foot specialist, GPT-4 generates practical and categorized care recommendations, including immediate actions, daily care protocols, and risk prevention strategies.

5.  **Step 4: Report Generation**:

      * All generated information‚Äîclassification, detailed analyses, and recommendations‚Äîis compiled into a structured **JSON report** that users can download for their records.
